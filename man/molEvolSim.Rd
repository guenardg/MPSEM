}
\details{
The molecular evolution model is based on a set of locations that
can take one of five states, namely gap ('-'), adenine ('A'), guanine ('G')
cytosine ('C'), or Thymine ('T'). A seed sequence is evolved one location at
a time. Changes from one nucleotides to another appear as nucleotide
transitions or transversions (shifts), whereas changes from a gap to one of
the nucleotides appear as an insertion and changes from one the nucleotides
to a gap as a deletion.

The changes are simulated as a simple Markov process, using a shift
probability matrix, which is calculated using a shift intensity matrix
\code{Q}. The off-diagonal elements of this matrix can be calculated from a
DNA evolution model by \code{DNArate()}, The diagonal elements are defined by
construct. Multiple shift intensity matrices can be employed for various
simulated sequences, it necessary.

Gap-only locations are discarded at the outset of the process, yielding sets
of sequences that are more or less shorter than the prescribed number of
nucleotides depending on the gap frequency used in the initial sequence. The
initial (root) sequence can be drawn from a uniform distribution with
user-defined frequencies (i.e., using function
\code{link{drawDNASequence}}), whereas each location's evolution rate can be
drawn from a gamma distribution (i.e., using function
\code{link{drawEvolRate}}).

The molecular evolution simulator can be instantiated multiple times, by
calling \code{molEvolSim} multiple times and storing the results into a list.
For instance, if every single location is assigned its own evolution rate, a
simulator is implemented for every single location. Then, member function
\code{$evolve(N)} is called to evolve a location 'N', with the returned value
being the new location value. When the time step of evolution rate change,
member function \code{$recalculate(step, rho)} is called to update the
shift probability matrix with time step 'step' and evolution rate 'rho'.
The shift matrix is obtained using member function \code{$getMt()}.

The gap opening and closure rates (arguments \code{gepOpen} and
\code{gspClose}, respectively) correspond to the total of the four changes
(from A, G, C, or T to a gap in the case of the gap opening rate and from a
gap to A, G, C, or T, in the case of a gap closure).

Models \code{"JC69"}, \code{"K80"}, and \code{"K81"} do not require
equilibrium base frequencies (argument \code{pi}), since they assume equal
equilibrium base frequencies, whereas model \code{"T92"} uses parameter
\code{piGC} to calculate these frequencies. Therefore, these models will
disregard any values provided to argument \code{pi}. For the other model,
unequal equilibrium base frequencies may be provided through argument
\code{pi}. Otherwise, equal equilibrium base frequencies are assumed in all
cases. Argument \code{par} is disregarded by models \code{"JC69"} and
\code{"F81"}. The number of values provided to that argument varies depending
on the model. \code{"K80"}, \code{"HKY85"}, and \code{"T92"} require a single
value, \code{"K81"} and \code{"TN93"}, require two; and \code{"GTR"} requires
six. In all cases, omitting \code{par} will yield a model equivalent to
\code{"F81"} (or \code{"JC69"} with equal equilibrium base frequencies).
Permissible values for argument \code{par} are positive values and are
subjected to further constraints that depend on the model.

The \code{"JC69"} and \code{"F81"} models take no \code{par} value. The
value of the single parameter (\code{par[1]}) of models \code{"K80"},
\code{"HKY85"}, and \code{"T92"}, as well as the two parameters of model
\code{"TN93"}, have to be between 0 and 1. For the \code{"K81"} model, the
two parameters also must have a sum smaller than, or equal to 1. Finally, the
six parameters of the \code{"GTR"} model must sum to 6, but can be
individually larger than 1.

Function \code{simulateSequence()} is assigned a random sequence at the
origin vertex (or vertices) of the evolutionary graph through its argument
\code{sqn}, and also takes a set of evolution rate (one for each location)
through its argument \code{rate}. The DNA sequence evolution is simulated as
a Markov process described by the transition intensity matrix given as
argument \code{Q}.

## Get the transition probability matrix as follows:
em1$getMt()

## A vector of raw as examples of initial traits:

rawToChar(em1$evolve(tr[3L]))    ## a guanine base.
rawToChar(em1$evolve(tr[4L]))    ## a cytosine base.

## Simulate the evolution of a sequence with 100 base pairs for 250 generations.
Ngeneration <- 250
Nnucleotide <- 100

## This is the matrix holding the sequences:
seq <- matrix(raw(), Ngeneration, Nnucleotide)

## Drawing the initial sequence:
seq[1,] <- drawDNASequence(Nnucleotide, piGap = 0.25, pi = c(0.4,0.4,0.1,0.1))

## Each site has its own mean evolution rate, which are drawn as follows:
erate <- drawEvolRate(Nnucleotide, gamma.shape = 5, gamma.scale = 5e-03)

## Using the Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano (1985) model:
DNArate(
  model = "HKY85",
  piGap = 0.25,
  deletionRate = 0.1,
  insertionRate = 0.1,
  pi = c(0.4, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1),
  par = 0.25
) -> Q

## Instantiating a molecular evolution models for each site using the single
## change rate matrix, a constant time step of 1 (Ma), and individual mean
## evolution rates drawn previously:
em <- list()
for(j in 1:Nnucleotide)
  em[[j]] <- molEvolSim(Q = Q, step = 1, rho = erate[j])

## These for loops call the $evolve() function to evolve each site for each
## generation as follows:
for(i in 2:Ngeneration)
  for(j in 1:Nnucleotide)
    seq[i, j] <- em[[j]]$evolve(seq[i - 1, j])

## Sequences with the gaps (perfect alignment):
concatenate(seq) \%>\%
  show.sequence

## Sequences with the gaps removed (prior to multiple sequence alignment):
concatenate(seq, discard="-") \%>\%
  show.sequence

### Examples for molEvolSim() here...

## Clean up:
rm(Q, em1, tr, Ngeneration, Nnucleotide, seq, erate, em, i, j)

\usage{
dstGraph(d, th, origin, stretch)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A dissimilarity matrix such as the one obtained from
\code{\link[stats]{dist}} or \code{\link[ape]{dist.dna}}.}

\item{th}{Numeric. A threshold value for dissimilarity. Vertices are
considered as connected whenever their pairwise dissimilarity value is
smaller or equal to that value.}

\item{origin}{Integer. Index of the origin vertex from which the edges are
directed.}

\item{stretch}{Numeric (optional). When a vertex is unreachable, stretch the
threshold value for the shortest edge connecting it to the rest of the graph
up to that value.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{graph-class}} object.
}
\description{
Calculates a distance-based directed graph from a dissimilarity matrix, a
threshold value, and an origin (or root) vertex.
}
\details{
The algorithm

Beginning on a user-defined origin vertex, the algorithm proceeds by
connecting all vertices within a given dissimilarity value from the ones that
have already been connected, until all the vertices that can be reached has
been reached. Optionally, the dissimilarity threshold value can be stretched
for the vertices that are unreachable. Vertices that cannot be reached in any
way are reported by the function.

\examples{

## We set the seed to obtain a consistent example, but you are welcome to
## experiment with other graphs.
set.seed(7653401)

## Here, the dissimilarity matrix is generated from the Euclidean distance of
## a two-dimensional plot for the sake of simplicity. In practice, the matrix
## will come from DNA data using a dissimilarity method such as those
## implemented by  ape packages's function dist.dna().

N <- 100
coords <- cbind(x=runif(N,-1,1), y=runif(N,-1,1))
rownames(coords) <- sprintf("N\%d",1:N)
dst <- dist(coords)

## Calculate the distance-based graph:
gr <- dstGraph(d=dst, th=0.25, origin=15)

## This graph have unconnected vertices.

## Plotting the graph with colors indicating the order of the edges:
plot(coords, type="n", asp=1)
col <- head(rainbow(max(gr$order) + 1), max(gr$order))
arrows(
  x0 = coords[edge(gr)[[1]],1],
  x1 = coords[edge(gr)[[2]],1],
  y0 = coords[edge(gr)[[1]],2],
  y1 = coords[edge(gr)[[2]],2],
  length = 0.05,
  col = col[gr$order[edge(gr)[[2]]]]
)
points(coords, pch=21, bg="black", cex=0.25)

## Try again raising the threshold to help in connecting all the vertices:
gr <- dstGraph(d=dst, th=0.28, origin=15)

## It helped, but does not entirely solve the matter.

plot(coords, type="n", asp=1)
col <- head(rainbow(max(gr$order) + 1), max(gr$order))
arrows(
  x0 = coords[edge(gr)[[1]],1],
  x1 = coords[edge(gr)[[2]],1],
  y0 = coords[edge(gr)[[1]],2],
  y1 = coords[edge(gr)[[2]],2],
  length = 0.05,
  col = col[gr$order[edge(gr)[[2]]]]
)
points(coords, pch=21, bg="black", cex=0.25)

## Try again while stretching the threshold for the unconnected vertices:
gr <- dstGraph(d=dst, th=0.28, origin=15, stretch=0.5)

## All the vertices are now connected.

plot(coords, type="n", asp=1)
col <- head(rainbow(max(gr$order) + 1), max(gr$order))
arrows(
  x0 = coords[edge(gr)[[1]],1],
  x1 = coords[edge(gr)[[2]],1],
  y0 = coords[edge(gr)[[1]],2],
  y1 = coords[edge(gr)[[2]],2],
  length = 0.05,
  col = col[gr$order[edge(gr)[[2]]]]
)
points(coords, pch=21, bg="black", cex=0.25)

## This is the influence matrix of that directed graph:
tmp <- InflMat(gr)

## An image plot of this influence matrix:
image(t(tmp[nrow(tmp):1L,]), col=gray(c(1,0)), asp=1)

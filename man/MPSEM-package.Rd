Phylogenetic eignevector maps (PEM) is a method for using phylogeny
to model features of organism, most notably quantitative traits. It consists
in calculating sets of explanatory variables (eigenvectors) that are meant to
represent different patterns in trait values that are likely to have been
inducted by evolution. These patterns are used to model the data, using a
linear model for instance.

If one in interested in a \sQuote{target} species (i.e. a species for which the trait
value is unknown), and provided that we know the phylogenetic relationships
between that species and those of the model, the method allows us to obtain the
scores of that new species on the phylogenetic eigenfunctions underlying a
PEM. These scores are used to make empirical predictions of trait values for
the target species on the basis of those observed for the species used in the
model.

Functions \code{\link{PEM.build}}, \code{\link{PEM.updater}},
\code{\link{PEM.fitSimple}}, and \code{\link{PEM.forcedSimple}} allow one to
build, update (i.e. recalculate with alternative weighting parameters) as well
as to estimate or force arbitrary values for the weighting function
parameters.

Functions \code{\link{getGraphLocations}} and
\code{\link{Locations2PEMscores}} allow one to make predictions using method
\code{\link{predict.PEM}} and a linear model. To obtain this linear model,
one can use either function \code{\link{lm}} or auxiliary functions
\code{\link{lmforwardsequentialsidak}} or
\code{\link{lmforwardsequentialAICc}}, which perform forward-stepwise
variable addition on the basis of either familiwise type I error rate or the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), respectively.

The package provides low-level utility functions for performing operations on
graphs (see \link{graph-functions}), calculate influence matrix
(\code{\link{PEMInfluence}}), and simulate trait values (see
\link{trait-simulator}).

A phylogenetic modelling tutorial using \code{MPSEM} is available as a

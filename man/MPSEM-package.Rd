Phylogenetic eignevector maps (PEM) is a method for using phylogeny
to model features of organism, most notably quantitative traits. It consists
in calculating sets of explanatory variables (eigenvectors) that are meant to
represent different patterns in trait values that are likely to have been
inducted by evolution. These patterns are used to model the data, using a
linear model for instance.

If one in interested in a \sQuote{target} species (i.e. a species for which
the trait value is unknown), and provided that we know the phylogenetic
relationships between that species and those of the model, the method allows
us to obtain the scores of that new species on the phylogenetic
eigenfunctions underlying a PEM. These scores are used to make empirical
predictions of trait values for the target species on the basis of those
observed for the species used in the model.



The package provides low-level utility functions for performing operations on
graphs (see \link{graph-functions}), calculate influence matrix
(\code{\link{InflMat}}), and so on.

A phylogenetic modelling tutorial using \code{MPSEM} is available as a
package vignette. See example below.

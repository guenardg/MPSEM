\description{
Functions to calculate the harmonic mean and weighted harmonic
mean of a set of data.
}
\details{
The (weighted) harmonic mean of a data set is the inverse of the
(weighted) mean of the inverse values. As such, any 0 value in the data (or
in the non-zero weighted data in the weighted case) will result in the
functions returning a value of 0. It is worth recall that whereas the value
of the arithmetic mean is strongly influenced by even a few extreme values,
the value of the harmonic mean is strongly influenced by even a few small
values. The function take any numeric values. However, the harmonic mean of
data containing both positive and negative values is unlikely to be stable.

\usage{
graph(data = data.frame())

add.vertex(x, data = data.frame())

add.edge(x, from, to, data = data.frame())

rm.edge(x, id)

rm.vertex(x, id)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{\link{data.frame}} providing data (and labels) to be
assigned to the vertices or edges. It can be an empty data frame with row
names providing the vertex labels.}

\item{x}{A \code{graph-class} object.}

\item{from}{An integer or character vector. References to the origin of the
edges to be added.}

\item{to}{An integer or character vector. The destinations of the edges to be
added (vertex references).}

\item{id}{An integer or character vector. The identity of vertex or edge to
be removed (references).}
}
\description{
A set of primitive functions for creating and munipulating
MPSEM graphs.
}
\details{
A new graph is populated with vertices using function
\code{graph()}. The function must be provided with a data frame. This data
frame may be a 0 column data frame as long as its \code{row.names} attribute
contains the number of elements necessary to reference the vertices.
Additional vertices can be added later with function \code{add.vertex()}. The
graph thus created contains no edge; the latter are added using function
\code{add.edge()}. Edges and vertices are removed using functions
\code{rm.edge()} and \code{rm.vertex()}, respectively.

\examples{

## Populate a graph with 7 vertices labeled A-G and edge properties x and y:
data.frame(
  quantitative = c(1.1,7.2,7.2,4.1,5.5,6.9,3.3),
  factor = factor(c("A","A","A","B","B","B","B")),
  row.names = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G")
) \%>\%
  graph -> x

## Note from package magrittr:
## x \%>\% f(y, z)    is equivalent to f(x, y, z)
## x \%<>\% f(y, z)   is equivalent to x <- f(x, y, z)

## Add three vertices without descriptors:
x \%>\% add.vertex(
  data = data.frame(row.names = c("H","I","J"))
)

## This is another way to add vertices:
x \%<>\% add.vertex(
  data = data.frame(
    factor = factor(c("C","C","C")),
    ordered = ordered(c(1,2,2)),
    row.names = c("H","I","J")
  )
)

## Adding 10 edges, labeled E1-E10 and with properties d and r, to the graph:
x \%<>\% add.edge(
  from = c("A","B","B","C","C","D","D","E","E","F"),
  to = c("A","C","D","E","F","F","G","H","I","J"),
  data = data.frame(
    distance = c(1,5,2,3,3,2,5,1,1,1),
    reversible = c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE),
    row.names = paste("E",1:10,sep="")
  )
)

## Adding three more edges, this time without variable 'reversible', but
## adding a variable called 'factor':
x \%<>\% add.edge(
  from = c("E","F","G"),
  to = c("A","B","C"),
  data.frame(
    distance = c(2,3,1),
    factor = factor(c("S","S","G")),
    row.names = c("E1","E11","E23")
  )
)

## Removing two edges (E3 and E5):
x \%<>\% rm.edge(id=c("E3","E5"))

## Removing vertices B, F, and G with their associated edges:
x \%<>\% rm.vertex(id=c("B","F","G"))

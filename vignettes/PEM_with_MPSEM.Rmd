# Introduction

Phylogenetic Eigenvector Maps (**PEM**) is a method to perform phylogenetic
modelling. Phylogenetic modelling consists in modelling trait evolution and
predicting trait values using phylogeny as an explanatory factor [@Guenard2013].
Phylogenetic modelling allows one to predict trait values when it is difficult
or impractical to obtain them, for instance when species are rare, extinct, or
when information is needed for several species and trait values are only
available for a relatively small number of them [@Guenard2011;@Guenard2014].

To apply phylogenetic modelling, one needs to have a set of species with known
phylogeny and trait values (hereafter referred to as the _model species_) as
well as to know the locations, with respect to the phylogeny of the models
species, of the species for which trait values are being predicted (hereafter
referred to as the _target species_). Phylogenetic modelling can be performed
jointly with trait correlation modelling: it is possible to use other traits
with known (or estimable) values for the target species to help predict a trait
of interest. Phylogenetic trees being acyclic graphs, I will hereby prefer terms
belonging to the graph theory over terms phylogeneticists may be more familiar
with. Therefore I will use _edge_ over _branches_ and _vertex_ over _root_,
_node_ or _tip_; safe in cases where I want to be specific about what a vertex
represents.

The **PEM** work flow consists in

1) calculating the influence matrix of the graph,

2) specifying a model of trait evolution along the edges of the phylogenetic
tree,

3) calculating the left eigenvectors of the weighted and centred influence
matrix and

4) use these eigenvectors as descriptors [@Guenard2013].

An **R** language implementation of that approach is found in package **MPSEM**.
**MPSEM** was developed to make the aforementioned process as seamless as
possible. It is a work in progress; I welcome anyone to provide relevant
suggestions and constructive remarks aimed at making **MPSEM** a better, more
efficient and user-friendly, interface to phylogenetic modelling.

Assuming package **MPSEM** is installed, the first step to calculate a **PEM**
is to load package MPSEM, which depends on packages **ape** and **MASS**:

```{r load_package}
library(MPSEM)
```

# Preparing the data

For the present tutorial, we will use the data set **perissodactyla** from **R**
package **caper**. These data from @Purvis1995 are loaded into your **R**
workspace as follows:

```{r load_data}
data(perissodactyla,package="caper")
```

```{r plot_phylogeny, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width = 7}
par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
plot(perissodactyla.tree)
par(mar=c(5,4,4,2))
figCounter$register(
  "theTree",
  "The phylogenetic tree used for this example."
)
```
```{r, plot_phylogeny_cap, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
figCounter$getCaption("theTree")
```

The **perissodactyla** data set contains `perissodactyla.tree`, a phylogenetic
tree encompassing `r length(perissodactyla.tree$tip.label)` odd-toed ungulate
species (Fig. `r figCounter$getNumber("theTree")`) and `perissodactyla.data`, a
data frame containing information four trait for these species, namely, the
($\log_{10}$) of the adult female weight, gestation weight, and neonatal weight,
as well a fourth categorical trait telling whether of not the species has
territorial behaviour.

```{r data_table, echo=FALSE, results="latex"}
knitr::kable(perissodactyla.data)
```

There are four species for which territoriality is missing: the Sumatran
rhinoceros (_Dicerorhinus sumatrensis_), the Javan rhinoceros
(_Rhinoceros sondaicus_), the mountain tapir (_Tapirus pinchaque_), and the
South American tapir (_Tapirus terrestris_). For the benefit of this example,
we performed a quick search over the Internet to attempt at completing this
data. We came up with the following completion data:

```{r data_completion}
perissodactyla.data[c(2,9,12,13),"Territoriality"] <- c("No","No","Yes","Yes")
```

> These data are **not** the result of a professional enquiery and thus must not
> be used outside of the present example. Poeple interested in the behaviour of
> these species should seek advice from a competent scientist.

Before going any further, it is important to make sure that the species in the
tree object are the same and presented in the same order as the ones in the data
table. Glancing at the data table, species clearly cannot match since the latter
feature information for only `r nrow(perissodactyla.data)` of the
`r length(perissodactyla.tree$tip.label)` species in the tree. We will therefore
match the tip labels of the original tree in the data table using the binary
(Latin) species names in a character vector `spmatch`. When no matching element
from the data table is found, the value `NA` appears at the corresponding
position in `spmatch`. We can therefore use these missing values to reference
the species that can be dropped from the tree using function `drop.tip()` from
package **ape** as follows:

```{r droping_species}
match(
  perissodactyla.tree$tip.label,
  perissodactyla.data[,1L]
) -> spmatch

drop.tip(
  perissodactyla.tree,
  perissodactyla.tree$tip.label[is.na(spmatch)]
) -> perissodactyla.tree
```

Now that the data match the tree in terms of species content, we then need to
make sure that species ordering also matches as follows:

```{r check_order}
cbind(perissodactyla.tree$tip.label, perissodactyla.data[,1L])
```

Since they do not, we need to recalculate `spmatch` with the new, reduced, tree
and re-order the data accordingly:

```{r re-order_species}
match(
  perissodactyla.tree$tip.label,
  perissodactyla.data[,1L]
) -> spmatch

perissodactyla.data[spmatch,] -> perissodactyla.data

all(perissodactyla.tree$tip.label == perissodactyla.data[,1L])
```

The last code line is just a last check to guarantee that all species names are
matching. As a last step before we are done with data manipulation, I will put
the binary names in place of the row names and delete the table's first row:

```{r change_rownames}
perissodactyla.data[,1L] -> rownames(perissodactyla.data)
perissodactyla.data[,-1L] -> perissodactyla.data
```

The data now appear as follows:

```{r re-arranged_data, echo=FALSE, results="latex"}
knitr::kable(perissodactyla.data)
```


# Calculating **PEM**

## Edge weighting function

As previously announced, I use the vocabulary of the graph theory when
describing **PEM**: a tree is a (directed) graph, a branch is an edge, and the
root, nodes, and tips are vertices. **PEM** allows one to specify a model of
trait evolution along the edges of the tree. The trait evolution model is a
power function of the edge lengths, with parameters $a$ and $\psi$ describing
the shape of the relationship between the edge lengths and trait evolution rate:

$$
w_{a,\psi}(\phi_{j})=
\begin{cases}
\psi\phi^{\frac{1-a}{2}} & \phi_{j}>0\\
0 & \phi_{j}=0,
\end{cases}
$$
where $a$ is the steepness parameter describing how abrupt the changes in trait
values occur with time following branching, $\psi$ is the evolution rate of the
trait, and $\phi_{j}$ is the length of edge $j$ [@Guenard2013].

```{r display_weighting, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width = 7}
par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,1,7) + 0.1)
d <- seq(0, 2, length.out=1000)
a <- c(0,0.33,0.67,1,0.25,0.75,0)
psi <- c(1,1,1,1,0.65,0.65,0.4)
cc <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
ll <- c(1,2,2,2,3,3,3)
trial <- cbind(a, psi)
colnames(trial) <- c("a","psi")
ntrials <- nrow(trial)
nd <- length(d)
matrix(
  NA,
  ntrials,
  nd,
  dimnames=list(paste("a=", trial[,"a"], ", psi=", trial[,"psi"], sep=""),
                paste("d=", round(d,4), sep=""))
) -> w
for(i in 1:ntrials)
  w[i,] <- MPSEM::PEMweights(d, trial[i,"a"], trial[i,"psi"])
plot(NA, xlim=c(0,2), ylim=c(0,1.6), ylab="Weight", xlab="Distance", axes=FALSE)
axis(1, at=seq(0,2,0.5), label=seq(0,2,0.5))
axis(2, las=1)
text(expression(paste(~~~a~~~~~~~psi)),x=2.2,y=1.57,xpd=TRUE,adj=0)
for(i in 1:ntrials) {
  lines(x=d, y=w[i,], col=cc[i], lty=ll[i])
  text(paste(sprintf("%.2f", trial[i,1]), sprintf("%.2f",trial[i,2]), sep="  "),
       x=rep(2.2,1), y=w[i,1000], xpd=TRUE, adj=0)
}
rm(d,a,psi,cc,ll,trial,ntrials,nd,w,i)
figCounter$register(
  "edgeWeighting",
  paste(
    "Output of the edge weighting function for different sets of parameters",
    "$a$ and $\\psi$."
  )
)
```
```{r, display_weighting_cap, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
figCounter$getCaption("edgeWeighting")
```

As the steepness parameter increases, the weight assigned to a given edge
increases more sharply with respect to the phylogenetic distance (or
evolutionary time; Fig. `r figCounter$getNumber("edgeWeighting")`). In the
context of **PEM**, the edge weight represent the relative rate of evolution of
the trait; the greater the edge weight, the greater the trait change along that
edge. When $a=0$, trait evolution is neutral and therefore proceeds by random
walk along edges. When $a=1$, edge weights no longer increase as a function of
edge lengths. That situation corresponds to the scenario in which trait
evolution is driven by the strongest possible natural selection: following a
speciation event, trait either change abruptly (directional selection) at the
vertex or do not change at all (stabilizing selection).

Also, the shape parameters may differ for different parts of the phylogenetic
tree or network. For instance, the trait may have evolved neutrally at a steady
rate from the base of a tree up to a certain node, and then, may have been
subjected to different levels of selection pressure and various evolution rate
from some of the nodes towards their tips.

## Phylogenetic graph

The first step to build a **PEM** is to convert the phylogenetic tree. The is
done by giving the tree to function `as.graph()` as follows:

```{r convert_to_graph}
gr1 <- as.graph(perissodactyla.tree)
```

Here's a snipet showing how the graph container used by **MPSEM** stores graph
information:

```{r graph_storage,echo=FALSE}
str(gr1)
```

The object consists in a data frame containing the vertex information, together
with another data frame containing the edge information and stored as an
attribute called `edge`. The vertex data frame may have $0$ or more columns
containing vertex information and its rows reference the vertices (minimally,
their name labels, which are stored as the row names of the data frame). In the
present case, a logical vector created by `as.graph()` and called `$species`
stores whether a given vertex represents a species (_i.e._, it is a tip) or not
(_i.e._, it is a node). The `edge` attribute is a data frame containing
information about the edges of the graph, namely the indices of their origin and
destination vertices (the first two columns), and an arbitrary number of
supplementary columns storing any other edge properties. In the present case, a
numeric vector created by `as.graph()` and called `$distance` stores the
phylogenetic distances ($\phi_{j}$), which, in this example, correspond to the
branch lengths of `perissodactyla.tree`.

## Building the eigenvector map

Beginning on MPSEM version 0.6, **PEM** are generated using function `PEM`
(before version 0.6, a defunct function called `PEM.build()` was used for that
purpose). That function minimally takes a graph-class object and outputs a
PEM-class object. By default, the whole graph is assumed to have a single value
of the steepness parameter (_i.e._, assuming neutral evolution; $a=0$ for all
the graph's edges) and homogeneous evolution rate (_i.e._, $\psi = 1$ for all
the graph's edges). Function `PEM()` is called as follows:

```{r PEM1}
## Calculate the PEM object using the default:
perissodactyla.PEM <- PEM(gr1)

## Show the PEM object:
perissodactyla.PEM
```


### Heterogeneous evolutionary process

Heterogeneous evolutionary processes are defined by two linear sub models on the
graph's edges; one for parameter $a$ and one for parameter $\psi$. Each of these
models is itself defined using a model matrix and a parameter vector. These
model matrices have as many rows as the number of edges, and as many columns as
the numbers of parameters. The model matrix for $a$ ($\mathbf{M}_a$, argument
`mm_a`) needs at least a single all-ones column working together with a length
one parameter vector ($\mathbf{b}_a$) to represent a constant value to apply to
all edges (this is the default for `mm_a`). The value of $a$ for any edge $i$ is
obtained from the linear combination $\eta_i = \mathbf{M}_a \mathbf{b}_a$ as
follows:

$$
a_i = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\eta_i}},
$$

which constrains the value of $a_i$ between $0$ and $1$. The default value for
`mm_a` is a single-column all-ones matrix, whereas the single value for
$\mathbf{b}_a$ is $-\infty$, which makes $a_i = 0$ for all edges. The linear sub
model for $\psi$ is defined in a similar way, with the exception that it needs
no all-ones column. The value of $\psi$ for any edge $i$ is obtained from the
linear combination $\eta_i = \mathbf{M}_\psi \mathbf{b}_\psi$ as follows:

$$
\psi_i = \frac{2}{1 + e^{-\eta_i}},
$$

which constrains the values of $\psi$ between $0$ and $2$. The model matrix for
$\psi$ ($\mathbf{M}_{\psi}$, argument `mm_psi`) may be a zero-column matrix
working together with a length zero parameter vector ($\mathbf{b}_{\psi}$)
implying a constant value $\eta=0$ to apply to all edges.

The default behavior of function `PEM()` for `mm_psi` to be a zero-column matrix
and `b_psi` to be a zero-length vector thereby applying a constant value of
$\psi=1$ for all the edges of the graph.

The elements of the model matrices are binary values (_i.e._, taking either
values $0$ or $1$) which can be defined manually or using functions
`isUnderVertex()` or `isUnderEdge()`. Function `isUnderVertex()` generates sets
of vectors with the value $1$ for all edges under a given vertex and $0$
elsewhere. Likewise function `isUnderEdge()` generates sets of vectors with the
value $1$ for all edges under a given edge and $0$ elsewhere.

The following figure will help us figure out the indices of the edges involved:

```{r tree_labelled, fig.height=5, fig.width = 7}
perissodactyla.tree -> tree
sprintf("N%s",1L:tree$Nnode) -> tree$node.label

par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
plot(tree, show.node.label=TRUE)

edgelabels(
  sprintf("E%d",1L:nrow(tree$edge)),
  edge=1L:nrow(tree$edge),
  bg="white",
  cex=0.75
)
```
```{r tree_labelled_cap, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
figCounter$register(
  "trainingTree",
  "The labelled training species tree for this example."
)
figCounter$getCaption("trainingTree")
```

For instance, let us define a model matrix with a contrast for all species of
genus _Equus_, which are located under vertex _N8_, and a second contrast vector
for the complete lineage leading to species of genus _Tapirus_ from the rest of
the tree, which are all found under edge _E9_ as follows:

```{r contrast_equus}
cbind(
  isUnderVertex(gr1, "N9"),
  isUnderEdge(gr1,"E11")
) -> mm
mm
```

A **PEM** is generated on the basis of this model matrix using function `PEM()`
as follows:

```{r calculate_PEM1}
## Calculate the PEM:
PEM(
  x = gr1,
  a = c(-6,5,8),            ## steepness sub model parameters
  psi = c(-1,1),            ## evolution rate sub model parameters
  mm_a = cbind(1, mm),      ## model matrix: steepness sub model
  mm_psi = mm               ## model matrix: evolution rate sub model
) -> perissodactyla.PEM

## Show the PEM object:
perissodactyla.PEM

## Extract the graph from within the PEM-class object:
gr <- perissodactyla.PEM$graph()

## Show the steepness and evolution rate at the edges:
round(edge(gr)[,c("a","psi")],3)
```

In this example, it is assumed that the steepness and evolution rate are
$a \approx 0.269$ and $\psi \approx 0.538$ among genus _Equus_ (E15--E21),
$a \approx 0.881$ and $\psi \approx 1.462$ among genus _Tapirus_ (E9--E13), and
$a \approx 0.002$ and $\psi = 1$ from the root of the tree up to the vertex
where the two latter genera begin as well as among the other genera (E1--E8 and
E14). The models may involve more complex designs these two additive terms
(eg., nested factors, interaction terms) provided that the parameter values are
known or that sufficient data is available to estimate the parameters.

In addition to the phylogenetic graph, to evolution model matrices, and two
parameter vectors, function `PEM()` has an argument `d`, the name of the edge
property where the phylogenetic distances are stored and `sp`, the name of the
vertex property specifying what vertex is a species. The default values for `d`
and `sp` are those produced by `as.graph()`, and can therefore be omitted in
most cases. The pem-class object that is used to store **PEM** information is
rather complex and we will hereby refrain from browsing through it. Methods
`as.matrix` and `as.data.frame` enables one to extract the eigenvectors from the
`PEM-class` object. For a set of $n$ species, these methods return a matrix
encompassing at most $n - 1$ column vectors that can be used in models to
represent phylogenetic structure in traits. Here the phylogenetic patterns of
variation described by two eigenvectors of the **PEM** we calculated above:

```{r Eigenvector_example, fig.height=4, fig.width=7.5}
tmp <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(1.1,1.1,2.6,0.1))

## Singular vectors are extracted using the as.matrix method:
perissodactyla.U <- as.matrix(perissodactyla.PEM)

plot(perissodactyla.tree, x.lim=60, cex=1.0)

par(mar=c(1.1,0.1,2.6,1.1))
plot(NA, xlim=c(1,ncol(perissodactyla.U)), ylim=c(1,nrow(perissodactyla.U)),
     ylab="", xlab="", axes=FALSE, cex=1.5)

axis(3, at=1:ncol(perissodactyla.U), tick=FALSE, cex.axis=1.1,
     label=parse(text=sprintf("bold(u)[%d]",1:ncol(perissodactyla.U))))

absrng <- max(abs(perissodactyla.U))

for(i in 1:ncol(perissodactyla.U))
  points(
    x = rep(i,nrow(perissodactyla.U)),
    y = 1:nrow(perissodactyla.U),
    cex = 4*abs(perissodactyla.U[,i])/absrng,
    bg = grey(c(0,1))[1.5 + 0.5*sign(perissodactyla.U[,i])],
    pch=22
  )

par(tmp)
```
```{r Eigenvector_example_cap, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
figCounter$register(
  "eigenvectorExample",
  paste(
    "Example of a set of 12 eigenvectors obtained from the exemplary data set.",
    "The size of the markers scales linearly with the absolute value of the",
    "loadings, whereas the background colors are showing their signs (white:",
    "negative loadings, black: positive loadings)."
  )
)
figCounter$getCaption("eigenvectorExample")
```

For instance, the pattern shown by the first eigenvector essentially contrasts
Equids and the other odd-toed ungulate species, whereas the pattern shown by the
second eigenvector essentially contrasts tapirs and Rhinocerotids. The other
$10$ eigenvectors show various other smaller-scale phylogenetic patterns.

## Estimate weighting parameters empirically

Class PEM has a method called `evolution.model` to estimate the best set of
weighting function parameters to use for modelling, which are often unknown to
the user. From the initial values provided when creating the PEM-class object,
method `evolution.model` estimates the parameter empirically using restricted
maximum likelihood from one or more response variables provided to it through
its argument `y` and, optionally, from a set of auxiliary traits (argument `x`).

> Method `evolution.model` replaces the defunct function `PEM.fitSimple()`,
> enabled one to estimate the value of a single $a$ value, with $\psi=1$ for a
> tree. The framework developed since **MPSEM** version 0.6 enables more
> flexibility in specifying models with heterogeneous $a$ and $\psi$ for various
> parts of the phylogenetic network.

Method `evolution.model` requires a response variable (here the neonate weight)
that will be used to optimize the parameter vectors $\mathbf{b}_a$ and (as
required) $\mathbf{b}_\psi$ and is called as follows:


```{r PEM_opt1}
perissodactyla.PEM <- PEM(gr1, a = 0)   ## A simpler, single-steepness, model

evolution.model(
  object = perissodactyla.PEM,
  y = perissodactyla.data[,"log.neonatal.wt"]
) -> opt

opt
```

Method `evolution.model` returns a list with information about the optimization
process. Alternatively, the response trait (argument `y`) and any other
auxiliary trait (argument `x`; here the female weight and territoriality) may be
prepared using function `model.data` and then used as follows:

```{r PEM_opt2}
perissodactyla.PEM_aux <- PEM(gr1, a = 0)

## Data preparation:
model.data(
  formula = log.neonatal.wt~log.female.wt+Territoriality,
  data = perissodactyla.data
) -> mdat

evolution.model(
  object = perissodactyla.PEM_aux,
  y = mdat$y,
  x = mdat$x
) -> opt_aux

opt_aux
```

Function `model.data` produces a list with the response traits (element `$y`)
and auxiliary traits (element `$x`) specified by a formula, with the data
provided using data frame, not unlike what functions like `lm` or `glm` perform
internally prior to model estimation. It is noteworthy that any call to
`evolution.model` automatically updates the PEM contained in the PEM object
provided to the method and makes the generalized least squares estimate of the
response trait variance (or residual variance with respect to the auxiliary
trait) available from within the PEM object. Response trait variance estimates
can later be accessed as follows:

```{r}
perissodactyla.PEM_aux$S2()
```

It is noteworthy that estimates of the steepness parameter (stored as
element `$optim\$par` of the **PEM** objects) and, consequently, the resulting
phylogenetic eigenvectors, will be different depending on the use of auxiliary
traits. In the example above, for instance, $\eta_a$ was estimated to
`r round(opt$par$a, 2)` in the first call, when no auxiliary trait is involved
and to `r round(opt_aux$par$a, 2)` in the second call, when the female weight is
used as an auxiliary trait.

## Prediction scores

The location of any target species is some distance from its latest common
ancestor (LCA) with respect to the species of the graph, which itself is found
either at a vertex, or on an edge at a specific distance from its origin. Class
PEM has a `predict` method that returns prediction scores for any graph
location, be it at a vertex or at any point along an edge. This method
internally calls one of two embedded functions for any target. These embedded
functions are called `$predictVertex()` and `$predictEdge()` and return the
**PEM** prediction scores for any vertex or edge, respectively. PEM method
`predict` is called as follows:

```{r}
## Model without an auxiliary trait.
predict(
  object = perissodactyla.PEM,
  newdata = data.frame(
    row.names = sprintf("target_%d",1:6),
    ref = c(1,3,5,2,3,4),
    dist = c(NA,0.1,NA,NA,0.4,1.1),
    lca = c(0,2,2.3,0,2,1.1)
  )
)

## Model with two auxiliary traits.
predict(
  object = perissodactyla.PEM_aux,
  newdata = data.frame(
    row.names = sprintf("target_%d",1:6),
    ref = c(1,3,5,2,3,4),
    dist = c(NA,0.1,NA,NA,0.4,1.1),
    lca = c(0,2,2.3,0,2,1.1)
  )
)
```

Argument `newdata` is a three-column data frame with the following contents:

_ref_
: an integer giving the index of the vertex or edge where the LCA is found,

_dist_
: a numeric vector; for indices in _ref_ that are edges, the distance from the 
edge origin where the LCA is found, for indices that are vertices, a missing
values,

_lca_
: a numeric vector giving the distance of the target from the LCA.

The method returns a matrix of **PEM** scores to be used as predictors with
an attribute called `"vf"` giving the prediction variance increment associated
with the distance between the LCA and the target. 

## Phylogenetic modelling

To model trait values, **PEM** are used as descriptors in other modelling
method. Any suitable method can be used. The eigenvectors from the **PEM** are
obtained from method `as.matrix` or `as.data.frame` as follows:

```{r extract}
## Extract the eigenvector as a matrix:
as.matrix(perissodactyla.PEM)

## Extract the eigenvector as a data frame:
as.data.frame(perissodactyla.PEM)
```

Package **MPSEM** includes a framework for ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression based on **R**'s `lm` function and methods. This framwork is
implemented by function `pemlm`, which called as follows:

```{r build_pemlm_models}
## A first pemlm model without an auxiliary trait:
pemlm(
  log.neonatal.wt~1,
  perissodactyla.data,
  perissodactyla.PEM
) -> lm1

## Summary of the first model:
summary(lm1)

## Anova of the first model:
anova(lm1)

## A second pemlm model with two auxiliary traits:
pemlm(
  log.neonatal.wt~log.female.wt+Territoriality,
  perissodactyla.data,
  perissodactyla.PEM_aux
) -> lm2

## Summary of the second model:
summary(lm2)

## Anova of the second model:
anova(lm2)
```

Models produced by `pemlm` do not immediately include phylogenetic eigenvectors.
The process for adding phylogenetic eigenvectors to the model is mediated using
a set of embedded functions, a complete description of which would be beyond the
scope of the present document. Embedded function `$forward` performs stepwise
variable addition of the **PEM** eigenfunctions on the basis of the corrected
Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) [@Hurvich1993] as follows:

```{r forward_select_pemlm_models}
## Adding eigenfunctions to the first model until the smallest AICc is reached
lm1$forward()
lm1

## Calculating the summary and anova 
summary(lm1)
anova(lm1)

## Adding eigenfunctions to the second model until the smallest AICc is reached
lm2$forward()
lm2

summary(lm2)
anova(lm2)
```

## Making predictions

The perisoadctyla data set has one missing gestation weight value for the
mountain tapir (_Tapirus pinchaque_). Here, we will exemplify how to make
predictions by estimating its most likely value. First, we need a graph (here a
tree) for all the species with the exception of _Tapirus pinchaque_, and the
coordinates of that species in that graph. This is accomplished by method
`locate` as follows:

```{r locate1}
sp <- "Tapirus pinchaque"     ## A selected species.
train <- locate(gr1, sp)      ## The locate method.
train
```

Here, we can se that _Tapirus pinchaque_ is located at distance
`r train$location$ladist` from and LCA located at distance
`r train$location$dist` along an edge with index `r train$location$ref`. The
`locate` method returns a two-element list whose first member (`$x`) is the
graph where the target species have been removed (ie. the residual graph) and
whose second member (`$location`) a three-column date frame of the graph
location (columns _ref_, _dist_, and _lca_ described previously) for each of the
targets. We then need to prepare the model data for all the traits available as
follows:

```{r}
## Prepare the model data:
model.data(
  formula = log.gestation.length~log.female.wt+log.neonatal.wt+Territoriality,
  data = perissodactyla.data
) -> mdat
```

For making predictions, we need to build a **PEM** using residual graph obtain
from method `locate` as follows:

```{r}
## Initial PEM (single a = 0.5, single psi = 1) built from the residual graph:
pem.train <- PEM(train$x, a = 0)

## Estimate the evolution model:
evolution.model(
  object = pem.train,
  y = mdat$y[names(mdat$y) != sp],
  x = mdat$x[rownames(mdat$x) != sp,]
) -> opt

## Build a linear model:
pemlm(
  formula = log.gestation.length~log.female.wt+log.neonatal.wt+Territoriality,
  data = perissodactyla.data %>% .[rownames(.) != sp,],
  pem = pem.train
) -> lm3

## Summary and anova for the auxiliary trait model:
summary(lm3)
anova(lm3)

## Add the phylogenetic eigenfunctions:
lm3$forward()

## Summary and anova for the final model:
summary(lm3)
anova(lm3)
```

Finally, we use the `predict()` method (for `pemlm-class` objects) to obtain the
predicted value as follows:

```{r}
## Make the prediction:
predict(
  object = lm3,
  newdata = perissodactyla.data[sp,],
  newloc = train$location
) -> prd
prd

## Substitute the missing value for the estimated gestation time:
perissodactyla.data[sp,"log.gestation.length"] <- prd
```


# Cross-validation of **PEM** predictions

Here is and example of how to perform a leave-one-out cross-validation of a data
set using the **R** code featured in the previous sections. Predictions will be
added to table to a table called `perissodactyla.pred`. The cross-validation is
carried out as follows:

```{r cross-validation}
## Table storing the results:
data.frame(
  observed = perissodactyla.data$log.neonatal.wt,
  auxiliary = NA,
  predictions = NA,
  lower = NA,
  upper = NA,
  row.names = rownames(perissodactyla.data)
) -> perissodactyla.pred

## Obtaining the updated model data:
model.data(
  formula = log.neonatal.wt~log.female.wt+log.gestation.length+Territoriality,
  data = perissodactyla.data
) -> mdat

## For each species i:
for(i in 1L:nrow(perissodactyla.pred)) {
  
  ## Calculate the residual graph and location:
  train <- locate(gr1, rownames(perissodactyla.pred)[i])
  
  ## Calculate a PEM:
  pem.train <- PEM(train$x, a = 0)
  
  ## Estimate the evolution model:
  evolution.model(
    object = pem.train,
    y = mdat$y[-i],
    x = mdat$x[-i,]
  ) -> opt
  
  ## Build an empty (auxiliary trait only) pemlm model:
  pemlm(
    formula = log.neonatal.wt~log.female.wt+log.gestation.length+Territoriality,
    data = perissodactyla.data[-i,],
    pem = pem.train
  ) -> lm_cv
  
  ## Make prediction using the empty model:
  predict(
    lm_cv$auxModel,
    perissodactyla.data[i,]
  ) -> perissodactyla.pred[i,2L]
  
  ## Add the PEM eigenfunction(s) on the basis of the AICc:
  lm_cv$forward()
  
  ## Make the prediction using the PEM-based model, including the limits of the
  ## 95% prediction interval:
  predict(
    object = lm_cv,
    newdata = perissodactyla.data[i,],
    newloc = train$location,
    interval = "prediction"
  ) -> perissodactyla.pred[i,3L:5L]
}

## Prediction coefficient using the auxiliary traits alone:
Psquare(perissodactyla.pred$observed, perissodactyla.pred$auxiliary)

## Prediction coefficient using the PEM eigenfunctions:
Psquare(perissodactyla.pred$observed, perissodactyla.pred$predictions)
```

```{r plot_pred_obs, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
## Calculate the range of the whole data (predictions and interval limits):
rng <- range(perissodactyla.pred)

## Save the graphical parameters:
p <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)

## Generates an empty plot:
par(mar=c(5,5,2,2))
plot(NA, xlim=rng, ylim=rng, xlab="Observed (log) neonatal",
     ylab="predicted (log) neonatal", las=1, asp=1)

## Show the predictions without the PEM:
points(x=perissodactyla.pred$observed, y=perissodactyla.pred$auxiliary, pch=21,
       bg="blue")

## Show the predictions and their prediction intervals with the PEM:
arrows(x0=perissodactyla.pred$observed, x1=perissodactyla.pred$observed,
       y0=perissodactyla.pred$lower, y1=perissodactyla.pred$upper, code=3,
       angle=90, length=0.05)
points(x=perissodactyla.pred$observed, y=perissodactyla.pred$predictions,
       pch=21, bg="black")

## 1:1 line:
abline(0,1)

## Restore the graphical parameters:
par(p)

figCounter$register(
  "crossPreds",
  paste(
    "Leave-one-out crossvalidated prediction of the neonatal weight for",
    nrow((perissodactyla.data)),
    "odd-toed ungulate species."
  )
)
```
```{r plot_pred_obs_cap, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
figCounter$getCaption("crossPreds")
```

From the present cross-validation, we found that the ($\log_{10}$) neonatal body
mass can be predicted with a cross-validated $R^{2}$ of
`r round(Psquare(perissodactyla.pred$observed, perissodactyla.pred$predictions),2)`
(Fig. `r figCounter$getNumber("crossPreds")`).

# Other utility functions

## Influence matrix

The influence matrix is used internally to calculate **PEM**. It is a matrix
having as many rows as the number of vertices (species + nodes) and as many
columns as the number of edges. Any given element of the influence matrix is
coding whether a vertex, which is represented a row of the matrix is influenced
an edge, which is represented by a column of the matrix. In the context of
**PEM**, a vertex is influenced by an edge when the former has ancestors on the
latter or, in other words, when an edge is on the path leading from a tip to the
root of the tree. The influence matrix is obtained as follows:

```{r influence_matrix}
InflMat(gr1) -> res
res
```

## Update and a **PEM** with new parameters

The calculation of the influence matrix performed by `PEM()` for a given
phylogenetic graph need not be done every time new weighting function parameters
are to be tried. For that reason, **MPSEM** provides an update method for the
PEM class that takes a previously calculated **PEM** object, applies new
edge weighting, and recalculates the phylogenetic eigenvectors:

```{r PEM_updater}
## Update the PEM object, setting a to 0.9:
update(perissodactyla.PEM, a = log(0.9/(1 - 0.9)), psi=NULL)

## Access the parameter values
perissodactyla.PEM$par()

## The parameter values are also available from the edge properties:
edge(perissodactyla.PEM$graph())
```

The response trait variance estimates will not readily be updated by the update
method 

```{r forcedNewParameters}
## Old trait variance value:
perissodactyla.PEM$S2()

## Recalculating trait variance:
perissodactyla.PEM$S2(y = perissodactyla.data[,"log.neonatal.wt"])

## The new trait variance value is available thereafter:
perissodactyla.PEM$S2()
```
